When we first arrived, there were issues with the garage and a few items inside, however, they the had maintenance fix the issues right away. Very pleased with the management and love this spot for a big group ski trip.',

        Cons: This unit would be stellar if a few small touches/upgrades were made. For example, a few blinds were missing in the kitchen nook, and the ones that were there were old. There weren't any curtains in the living area where the sleeper sofa is located so it was hard to sleep once the sun started shining in.`,

Only two towels per bathroom. We are 4 what about the pool?? No dishwasher detergent had to handwash dishes. Some lights in kitchen didnt work. Bottomline can't sleep can't stay.`,
